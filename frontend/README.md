# Frontend part of Final Project

This boilerplate is designed to give you a head start in your React projects, with a focus on understanding the structure and components. As a student of Technigo, you'll find this guide helpful in navigating and utilizing the repository.

## Getting Started

1.  Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
2.  Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

for me:

components:
the body(model)
model stand
clothes
swipe arrows
hamburger menu(repeating through routes)
title(reapeating through routes)
modal popups (reusable) ex. welcome, take pic of body, upload clothes, view camera pic of clothes, login
camera and pic library button (reusable) - add props to change different action and icon
exit button (reusable)
popup "garment saved"
upload clothes button
